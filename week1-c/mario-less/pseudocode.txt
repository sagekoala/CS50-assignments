int main(void)

// Do while will repeat loop to prompt user for a value within the range 1-8 if it's not provided
Do
{

Prompt user to ask for size

}

While ( size < 1 || size > 8 );

Create 1 for loop for the rows
initialize outer loop to i = 1, check condition i < n, update i + 1 after each loop
    Create a nested inner for loop for the columns
        initialize inner loop to j = 1, check condition j < n, update i + 1 after each loop
            Within the inner loop create if statement to print # if j is odd number
            for (i = 0; i < n; i++);

A pyramid alternates between even and odd numbers so the modulus operator could come in handy
Use the \n next line code strategically to signal when to move down the pyramid

n % j -
example n = 4
The loop would go
4
3
2
1
you can use character format placeholder and pass through to print a variable that assigns the position to put the #
Using the above example, pound would need to be placed: n-3, n-2, n-1, n
