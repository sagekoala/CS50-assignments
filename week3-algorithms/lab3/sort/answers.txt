sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Bubble sort has an upper bound n^2, and a lower bound of n. This difference becomes more apparent in the larger
data sets. In the largest data set, there is a big variance between the time it takes sort1 to evaluate the sorted data v. how long it takes sort1
to evaluate the unsorted data set.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Sort2 is consistently the fastest algorithm of the three. Sort2 performs consistently on both the sorted and unsorted data sets,
and outperforms the other two sorting data sets on the larger data sets.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: It performs consistently in all of the data sets for both sorted and unsorted data sets.
It performs more poorly than the other programs as the data sets get larger. Performs equally on both the large sorted data set
and the large unsorted data sets.
